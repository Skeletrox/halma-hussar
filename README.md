# The Halma Hussar

Halma? Hussar?

## Halma

The Greek word for jump, Halma is a variation of checkers. This project plays Halma given an input board state. It is essentially the second assignment for CSCI 561, Fall 2019. I've invested too much time in making this to leave it as it is, so here it is for posterity. Don't copy for your next assignments!

## Hussar

The Hussars were typically the elite cavalry of the Eastern European / Balkan Kingdoms. Most notably, the **Polish Winged Hussars** were among the most feared and powerful units of their time, [regularly routing armies much larger than themselves](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/hussars.html) for over two centuries.

![There's supposed to be an image of a Winged Hussar here, but I guess you can do a Google Search instead](https://cdn.forums.splashdamage.com/original/3X/7/2/721cfc785adbdfe8983e1c7c58aabfa2fbc2fb0a.jpg)

Bring the two together as you will.

If you still aren't convinced about the badassery of the Winged Hussars, here's a video for you.

## Why C++

Don't ask why. Ask why not.

## Improvements

I'm planning a Halma Panzer with CUDA support so that execution is even faster.
